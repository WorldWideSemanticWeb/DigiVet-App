        <h2>Outcome: BSE/Mad Cow Disease</h2>
        <p>It seems that your cow has BSE, a progressive degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system of cattle. The cause is unknown and unfortunately there is no known treatment for this fatal disease. The best thing to do is to seperate the sick cow from the other ones, in order to prevent possible spreading. Please select the image below to report your case and help raise awareness about this disease among veterinarians.</p>
